About
-----

Privly is a developing set of browser extensions for protecting content
wherever it is posted on the internet. This extension allows users to
view content on any website, without the host site being able to read
the content. For more information on what Privly is, `read about
us <https://priv.ly/pages/about>`__.

Development Status
------------------

**Pre-alpha Version**

About this Extension
--------------------

This extension currently supports:

-  Locally served posting and injectable applications.
-  All the implemented `Injectable
   Applications <https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Injectable-Applications>`__
   of the content server.

Installing/Testing/Submitting Bugs
----------------------------------

The installation instructions are found at `Safari Extension Development
Installation <https://priv.ly/pages/develop.html#SafariExtension>`__.

Extension integration test cases are found at
`test.privly.org <http://test.privly.org>`__. If you have discovered a
bug, only `open a public
issue <https://github.com/privly/privly-safari/issues/new>`__ on GitHub
if it could not possibly be a security related bug. If the bug affects
the security of the system, please report it privately by writing an
email to privly@privly.org. We will then fix the bug and follow a
process of responsible disclosure.

There are also unit and Selenium tests, which are found in the
privly-application git submodule.

Developer Documentation
-----------------------

Discussion of system concepts and high level processes are found in the
`central wiki <https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki>`__.
If you want to develop an injectable application, look in the
``privly-applications`` folder.
